/**
 * Event bus post events based on event class type. Subscriber uses method naming pattern to handle
 * call back from raised events. To handle an event with class type [EventType], subscribers
 * just need to have method named as <b>onEvent([EventType] event)</b>. Accessibility of the method
 * doesn't matter, so private, protected, public and package access are all allowed. There is an
 * internal implementation {@link EventBusImpl}
 *
 * <p>Event will be posted on the <b>SAME</b> thread the caller is running on by calling
 * {@link #post(Object)}</p>
 *
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <pre>
